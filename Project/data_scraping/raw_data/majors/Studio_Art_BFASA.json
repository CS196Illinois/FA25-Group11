As in Contemporary Art, work in New Media may take the form of performance, sound and radio broadcast, gallery exhibition, curation, public art, cinema and video, a networked event, publication, or even scientific research.",
          "Students concentrating in New Media are able to analyze and synthesize relevant aspects of human interaction in various contexts (physical, cognitive, cultural, social, political, and economic) and with respect to technologically- mediated communication, objects, and environments.  Junior and Senior years see students working with critics/professors across the School to develop a portfolio of works in time-based, interactive, physical, networked or performative media. In the process of generating a body of work around a subject and form of their choice, students receive instruction in technical execution, formal composition, and theoretical framing."
