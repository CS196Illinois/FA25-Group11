Students will work with an advisor in the Office of Academic Programs, to select coursework based on their interests with the purpose of declaring a major. The time within the program is ideally no more than 4 semesters, but an extension to a fifth semester is available. The goal is to move students to their intended degree program as soon as they have met the degree requirements and feel it is the best option for their career and interest goals."
