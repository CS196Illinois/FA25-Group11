Students are able to apply directly to EU as first-time freshmen or, if admitted to another college at Illinois, can apply to transfer via Intercollegiate Transfer to the program in their second and/or third semester at Illinois. External transfers to Illinois are not eligible for EU. Students will work with an Engineering Undeclared advisor to select coursework based on their interests with the purpose of exploring and declaring a major. All EU students must be declared in a major by the beginning of their fifth semester, but are eligible to apply to transfer as early as at the end of their second semester."
