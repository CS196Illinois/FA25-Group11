What kinds of production should be considered art? How are specific formal strategies informed by the perspectives of different subject positions? What politics underwrite them?

Accordingly, we will attempt to analyze these issues, make sense of the fundamental forces behind these dynamics, and understand their managerial implications. The class will focus then on the roots of International Business, and complement this focus with important practical implications and 'real-world' examples and cases - the ambition will always be to wed good theory with practice.

The range of texts we thus characterize as ""early British literature"" is staggering, and part of our goal in this course will simply be to appreciate the sheer volume and breadth of written work created in Britain and Ireland between the sixth and eighteenth centuries. We will do this through a necessarily selective sampling of historical periods, languages, and genres. Our authors will range from the famous (e.g., Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton) to the lesser-known (e.g., Marie de France, Lady Mary Wroth, and Eliza Haywood) to the unknown (e.g., the anonymous Beowulf-poet).

ERAM 557,Meaning Patterns: Semiotics and the Interpretation of Meanings in Education and the Social Sciences,4,"Addresses the ways in which knowledge is represented, with special reference to the knowledge representations of teachers and learners. Its interdisciplinary bases are functional linguistics, semiotics, philosophy, history of ideas, media/communication studies, and ontology in computer science. The focal point of the course is the five questions about meaning posed by Cope and Kalantzis in their transpositional grammar: ""what is this about?"" (reference); ""who or what is doing this?"" (agency); ""what holds this together?"" (structure); ""how does this fit with its surroundings?"" (context); and ""what is this for?"" (interest). Along these lines of inquiry, a transpositional grammar addresses language, image, embodied action, object and space. ""Transposition"" refers to the movement across these various forms of meaning, intensified in the era of pervasively multimodal, digitally-mediated communications. Applied to education, not only does this provide a valuable heuristic to reframe literacy teaching and learning (the original impulse for the development of this grammar). It also offers an integrated account of meaning-to-learn across all subject areas, including pedagogical content knowledge and learner knowledge representations. Conceived in the broader terms of social-scientific research methods, transpositional grammar is an attempt to overcome the narrowness and logocentrism of ""the language turn"" which dominated social sciences in the twentieth century. In a practical sense, semiotics of the kind explored in this course also provides tools for reading and interpreting multimodal texts and research data.",,https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/terms/ERAM/557

GWS 275,The Politics of Fashion,3,"Clothing is a medium for fashioning identities from commodities, and it is hardly surprising that political and social tensions are embodied in its fabrications. The politics of dress indicates inseparable links between cultures, aesthetics, and politics, as demonstrated in debates about Muslim practices of veiling, the role of clothing in colonialism’s ""civilizing"" mission, immigrant and ""third world"" sweatshop labor, fashion policing and subcultural style, and the fashion and modeling industries. Clearly manifest throughout these politics is the role of gender, race, nation, and sexuality, as relations of power and as critical factors for social life and creative imagination. This course requires weekly written reflections on the required readings; a written midterm; and a final project, which can be either a research paper or a creative project. The course also requires in-class participation (which will include pop quizzes, group discussion, and other exercises) and one individual or group presentation.

Formal methods are widely used in linguistics, mathematics, philosophy, and computer science. Within the general area of formal methods our approach in this course might be more specifically referred to as conceptual analysis, as it takes the form of a systematic analysis of a concept, namely information. Most of the prior work that is relevant to our analysis is from analytic philosophy, linguistics (especially formal semantics), and computer science (especially knowledge representation and AI).

Is the freer flow of trade, people, and capital around the world responsible for the world's economic, social, and political ills, or are we inclined to say that, on balance, it is still a good thing? As more people become more connected across larger distances in different ways, are they following more of the same norms and growing aware of what they share, or are they more aware of cultural differences and see integration as a threat to social cohesion? Upon completion of this course, students should be able to demonstrate content expertise using both written and verbal communication skills. They will do so by: identifying the different drivers of the phenomenon widely described as globalization; distinguishing between the social, cultural, political, and economic processes of globalization and give examples of how they interact in specific and contingent ways; analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of further global integration; combining the different aspects of globalization into a coherent narrative; designing and defending their own alter-globalization campaign.

We consider how different dimensions of inequality have evolved over time, with special focus on inequalities across race, class, and gender. We assess how inequality shapes the lives of individuals in society, how and why inequality persists, and how people have worked to both challenge and reproduce their places in society. We approach social inequality from a variety of angles, developing an understanding of how inequality works in and through schooling, labor markets, employment, identity and prejudice, social mobility, and the role of major social institutions such as work, family, education, politics and law. We examine core statements of social stratification from sociology and engage with contemporary theories from sociology, psychology, political science, and economics. By the end of this course, you will have a clearer understanding of the types of inequality that exist in society, how inequality operates through the broader social context, and the constraints and opportunities faced by individuals in different positions in society.
